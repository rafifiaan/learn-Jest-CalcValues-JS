## Calculate Values using Jest Framework by JavaScript

Hello, if you are interested in trying your own variations, do the following steps:

1. Install the test framework (Jest) first if you haven't already installed it, with the following devDependencies type:
```R
npm install --save-dev jest
```

2. Run a test with the following command:
```R
npm run test
```

3. If testing has been successful, check the test report by running the following command:
```R
npm run test -- --coverage
```
*the report will be added to the `coverage` directory and the overall test report will be logged in the `index.html` file*
